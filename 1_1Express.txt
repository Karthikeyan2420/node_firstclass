It provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.

express is the package , use require to get that package
initial express function to the app variable

get - it use to the show that content

The regular expression ^/$|/index(.html)? is used to match specific URLs, typically in routing or URL validation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

^ - Matches the start of the string.

/ - Matches a single forward slash /, often representing the root path of a website.

$ - Matches the end of the string.

So, ^/$ matches the root URL path / only.
| - Acts as an "or" operator, allowing either the expression on the left (^/$) or the expression on the right to match.

/index(.html)? - Matches /index, optionally followed by .html.
